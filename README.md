We are a support service that specializes in providing emotional and practical support to families of neurodiverse children. Our goal is to help families better understand their child's unique needs and strengths, and to provide the tools and strategies needed to support their child's development and well-being.

Our services include:

- One-on-one coaching: Personalized coaching with our team of experts, who will work with families to develop the skills and strategies they need to support their neurodiverse child.

- Workshops and training: Educational workshops and training sessions for parents, educators, and other professionals who work with neurodiverse individuals.

- Resource library: A collection of articles, blog posts, and other resources that provide guidance and support for neurodiverse families.

At Rethink Neuro, we believe that every child has the potential to thrive, and we are committed to helping families achieve their goals. If you have any questions or would like to learn more about our services, please don't hesitate to [email us](mailto:edyta@rethinkneuro.uk).
